            <h3>Welcome to the Ocean website! Here you will find information about the ocean and ways to protect it.</h3>
            <h2>The "Calendar" tab on this website provide a simple and effective way for individuals to take action in protecting the oceans. By completing daily tasks related to reducing their environmental impact, such as turning off lights or using a reusable water bottle, individuals can earn reward points. These points can be tracked and accumulated on the "Calendar" tab, and once a certain threshold is reached, they can redeem them for a tangible environmental benefit, such as the company collecting one piece of garbage from the ocean for every 1000 points earned. This incentivizes individuals to make small, daily changes that collectively can have a big impact on reducing pollution and protecting the oceans. By using the "Calendar" tabs, individuals can easily track and manage their progress towards a more sustainable lifestyle and contribute to a cleaner ocean.</h2>
